Docker Stacks: 
Services are capable of running single repicated application across nodes in the cluster, but what if you need to deploy a more complex application consisting of multiple services ?

A Stack is a collection of interrelated services that can be deployed and sclaed as a unit. 
===================================================================================================

create services in swarm using compose file ( declarative model )

        docker stack deploy -c compose.yml mystack
        docker stack ls
        docker stack ps mystack
        docker stack services mystack
        docker stack rm mystack
        docker service scale mysvc=3
