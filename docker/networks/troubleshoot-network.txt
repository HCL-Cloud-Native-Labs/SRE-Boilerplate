Network Troubleshooting:
   There are several ways we can gather information to troubleshoot networking issues. 
      docker logs CONTAINER  ==> Get container logs
	  docker service logs SERVICE ==> Get collated logs from the tasks of a service
	  journalctl -u docker ==> Get Docker Daemon logs.
   
   another way to troubleshoot network issues is to run a container within the context of a Docker Network. we can use it to test connectivity and gather information. 
   
   Netshoot is an image that come with a variety of network troubleshoot tools.
   we can run netshoot by using the container image nicolaka/netshoot
   we can even run netshoot within the network namespace of an existing container!
