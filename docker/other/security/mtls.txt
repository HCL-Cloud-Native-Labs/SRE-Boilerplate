MTLS in Docker Swarm:
Docker Swarm provides addtional security by encrypting communication between various components int he cluster. 

Mutually Authenticated Transport Layer Security (MTLS):
  1) Both participants in communication exchange certificates and all communication is authenticated and encrypted.
  2) when a swarm is initialized, a root certificate autority (CA) is created, which is used to genereate certificates for all nodes as they join the cluster. 
  3) worker and manager tokens are genereated using the CA and are used to join new nodes to the cluster.
  4) used for all cluster level communication between swarm nodes
  5) Enabled by default
