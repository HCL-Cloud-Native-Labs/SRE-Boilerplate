Namesapces are a linux technology that allows processes to be isolated in terms of the resources that they see. They can be used to prevent different processes from interfering or interacting with one another. 

Docker uses namespaces to isolate containers. This technology allows containers to operate independently and securely. 

Docker Engine uses namespaces such as the following on Linux:

	pid namespace: Process isolation (PID: Process ID).
	net namespace: Managing network interfaces (NET: Networking).
	ipc namespace: Managing access to IPC resources (IPC: InterProcess Communication).
	mnt namespace: Managing filesystem mount points (MNT: Mount).
	uts namespace: Isolating kernel and version identifiers. (UTS: Unix Timesharing System).
	User namespaces: requires special configuration. Allows container processes to run as root inside the container while mapping that user to an unprivileged user on the host.
