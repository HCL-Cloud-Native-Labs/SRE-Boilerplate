#### Asnible playbook is a script that consist set of instrucitons which we want to run on remote servers. the script is written using the ansible modules, in human frendly readable format by using yaml

#### YAML is a data serialization format. If you donâ€™t know what a data serialization format is, think of it as a way to translate a programmatic data structure (lists, arrays, dictionaries, etc) into a format that can be easily stored to disk.

#### The file can then be used to recreate the structure at a later point. JSON is another popular data serialization format, but YAML is much easier to read.

#### Each playbook contains one or more plays, which map hosts to a certain function. ansible does this through something called tasks, which are basically module calls
