## Things to know before working with ansible

1) ansible is agentless ( means, we do not need to run any agent on remote servers for communication )

2) ansible follows push model ( means we push the configuration from ansible controller to remote servers )

3) ansible uses SSH protocol to communicate with remote servers

4) ansible uses below methods for remote servers authentication

	* password based
	* key based


## Ansible controller ( is the machine/host/server where we install ansible )

* **/etc/ansible default directory ( we have two important file in it )**

* **hosts ( default inventory file in which we can mention remote servers we want to apply/push the** changes to)
* **ansible.cfg  ( default ansible configuraton - can be used to customize as per our need )**


## Ansible Terminlogy

1) ansible ad-hoc commands ( single task that can be executed against remote servers )

2) ansible playbooks  ( set of instructions written in a .yml file to execute against remote servers  )

3) ansible facts ( information about remote servers collected ansible before running any task )

4) ansible modules ( are the units of work that ansible ships to remote servers for executing the tasks )

5) ansible role ( to break a playbook into multiple files. This simplifies writing complex playbooks, and it makes them easier to reuse )
